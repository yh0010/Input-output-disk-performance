To test the whole process

```shell
sh build.sh
```

Example output log can be found in log.txt

To test the code with a sample iso file, download [ubuntu disk file](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/21.04/ubuntu-21.04-desktop-amd64.iso) and replace the filename in build.sh.

Or just compile and run fast.c by

```shell
gcc -O3 fast.c -o fast
./fast <filename>

```
